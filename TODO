1. Test /usr/share/wifi-switcher/hotspot.sh in case there are no networks.
2. In /usr/share/wifi-switcher/hotspot.sh use "while getopts" loop to pass options
   a. wifi interface
   b. name of the adhoc network
3. Move vsftpd, hostapd, and isc-dhcp-server from "Depends" to "Recommends"
   section of the debian/control file and set up trigger so that wifi-switcher
   is reconfigured every time they are installed/removed.
4. use osd notifications like "(dis)connected from/to wifi network"
   -- use dunst or another notification daemon to notify user of connections.
5. create emacs interface for wifi-switcher
6. Focus on using systemd? I do not want to loose compatibility with sysvinit...
