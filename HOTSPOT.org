* Description:
To transfer files between two linux computers, we use ssh or ftp server installed on one of them.

* Motivation:
I connect android and windows mobile devices to my linux netbook using ftp
capability of (free) "total commander" file manager.

* Setup
It is assumed that wifi-switcher is a monopolistic user of hostapd, vsftpd and
isc-dhcp-server; their auto-start is disabled and their configuration files are diverted.

It is important to allow ssh and ftp connections in the firewall setup (I use shorewall).
Below I copied some configuration files for vsftpd and shorewall.

** /etc/vsftpd.conf:
#+BEGIN_SRC
allow_writeable_chroot=YES
# if you allow file upload (write_enable), consider limiting the size of the ftp directory by
# placing it either on a separate partition, or inside the (mounted with "loop" option) file.
# [Attempt to enforce quota for the actual ftp directory owner (see guest_username) may result in server hang up.]
write_enable=YES
chroot_local_user=YES
anonymous_enable=NO
data_connection_timeout=12000
idle_session_timeout=12000
# enabling local ftp users defined in /etc/vsftpd.db (see below):
guest_enable=YES
local_enable=NO
# this is the system user which will own the files in the ftp directory
guest_username=ftp
# the way how local (non-system) users will be authenticated
pam_service_name=vsftpd
listen=YES
hide_ids=YES
secure_chroot_dir=/var/run/vsftpd/empty
use_localtime=YES
virtual_use_local_privs=YES
vsftpd_log_file=/var/log/vsftpd.log
xferlog_enable=YES
xferlog_file=/var/log/vsftpd.log
xferlog_std_format=YES
pasv_min_port=11000
pasv_max_port=11010
#+END_SRC

** /etc/pam.d/vsftpd
#+BEGIN_SRC
# the following lines refer to the file /etc/vsftpd.db
# which is created by the command
# echo -e "ftpUserName\nftpPassword" | db_load -T -t hash /etc/vsftpd.db
# (note that ftpUserName is not listed in the /etc/passwd file)
auth required pam_userdb.so db=/etc/vsftpd
account required pam_userdb.so db=/etc/vsftpd
#+END_SRC

** /etc/shorewall/interfaces:
#+BEGIN_SRC
net	eth0	detect	dhcp,tcpflags,nosmurfs,routefilter,logmartians
wifi	wlan0	detect	tcpflags,nosmurfs,routefilter,logmartians
#LAST LINE -- ADD YOUR ENTRIES BEFORE THIS ONE -- DO NOT REMOVE
#+END_SRC

** /etc/shorewall/rules:
#+BEGIN_SRC
# we accept connections on main ftp (21) port:
FTP(ACCEPT)	wifi		$FW
# we should also accept connections for ftp data ports configured in /etc/vsftpd.conf:

SSH/ACCEPT	all		$FW
DNS/ACCEPT	wifi		$FW
Ping/ACCEPT	$FW		all
Ping/DROP	net		$FW
