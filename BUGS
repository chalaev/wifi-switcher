* wifi-switcher-related issues
  1. I suggest users to stop auto-start for several services, typing the following (with root privileges):

	for i in $(service --status-all | grep "hostapd\|vsftpd\|isc-dhcp-server" | awk '{print $NF}') ; do
	    update-rc.d -f $i remove
	done

     These services can be restored anytime by

     	for i in $(service --status-all | grep "hostapd\|vsftpd\|isc-dhcp-server" | awk '{print $NF}') ; do
	    echo "restoring default service for $i"
	    update-rc.d -f $i defaults
	done

     <-- You may want to restore them, e.g., if you remove wifi-switcher but will still need these services.

     Exaplanation: wifi-switcher uses hostapd to create a wifi hotspot, so when hostapd daemon is running, it thinks that it has been
     switched into adhoc mode and shows only one menu item: "client mode". When hostapd is installed, it automatically inserts
     itself in the services list, so every time you call wifi-switcher from the menu for the first time after the computer is
     powered on, you will see "client mode" instead of the list of available wifi networks.  Before this behavior was fixed in the
     (de)installation script debian/postinst and debian/postrm, but this violates Debian policy.
  2. does not write psk into the /etc/wpa_supplicant/wifi-switcher.conf for a newly connected network.
     when the ssid has space(s).
  3. Rarely, wifi-switcher detects no wifi networks, even though there are some
     available. In this case restart the service (under root):
     service wifi-switcher restart
* wifi-switcher-unrelated issues
1. When I soft-block wifi with Fn-F2 key combination on my Asus EEE, and then suspend the system with Fn-z (Fn-F1), wifi gets
   hard-blocked (see the output of `rfkill list`), and only reboot helps to restore it. This does not happen on ThinkPad T430.
2. Unfortunately people tend to broadcast more than they actually need littering ether with numerous hotspots. Sometimes (when there
   are too many wifi networks) you have to choose the optimal wireless-channel in the file
   /etc/network/interfaces.d/wifi-switcher. I had to do this when there were 30 wifi networks available simultaneously in my office;
   these 30 networks were spread among only three channels, and my (non-free firmware-brcm80211) wireless-card driver perhaps does
   not realise that one should choose less occupied radio frequencies (channels) for better connection quality.
3. Sometimes wifi-switcher can not connect to an unprotected network, see iwlist-scan.output on
   https://github.com/chalaev/wifi-switcher
   This was a problem with the University of Rochester wifi network; it lasted for several months and then gone by itself.

* Issues on older debian versions
1. Inactive /etc/sudoers.d/ As of Debian version 1.7.2p1-1, the default /etc/sudoers
   file created on installation of the package now includes the directive:
   #includedir /etc/sudoers.d
   Problem: in earlier linux versions, files in
   /etc/sudoers.d/ might not be read.  This can be fixed by including the line
   #includedir /etc/sudoers.d
   into the /etc/sudoers file.
2. Similar problem with the directory /etc/network/interfaces.d/
   which is read by the command
   source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*
   which might be absent on earlier debian versions
