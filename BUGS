* General issues
1. Somehow two interfaces are chosen by postinst instead of one.
   Moreover, the "select" menu does not appear during `dpkg-reconfigure wifi-switcher`
   -- this just means that "Template: wifi-switcher/wifiInterface" is invalid
2. /etc/wpa_supplicant/wifi-switcher.conf is not erased during purge
3. Test hotspot.sh when there are no wifi networks available
4. When upgrading, installer asks if it should replace "manually changed" files.
5. Sometimes wifi-switcher is lying about the network ssid to which it is connected.
   This may happen when there are several known
   (listed in /etc/wpa_supplicant/wifi-switcher.conf) networks available simultaneously.
   The real ssid is given by the last line of `grep SSID /var/log/wifi-switcher.log`
6. Unfortunately people tend to broadcast more than they actually need littering ether
   with numerous hotspots. Sometimes (when there are too many wifi networks) you have to
   choose the optimal wireless-channel in the file
   /etc/network/interfaces.d/wifi-switcher. I had to do this when there were 30 wifi
   networks available simultaneously in my office; these 30 networks were spread among
   only three channels, and my (non-free firmware-brcm80211) wireless-card driver
   perhaps does not realise that one should choose less occupied radio frequencies
   (channels) for better connection quality.
7. Hotspot mode interrupted by the dpkg-reconfigure command is not restored after
   reconfiguring.
8. I suspect that sometimes the interface (say, wlan0) has to be brought up manually using the `ifconfig wlan0 up` command.

* Issues on older debian versions
1. Inactive /etc/sudoers.d/ As of Debian version 1.7.2p1-1, the default /etc/sudoers
   file created on installation of the package now includes the directive:
   #includedir /etc/sudoers.d
   Problem: in earlier linux versions, files in
   /etc/sudoers.d/ might not be read.  This can be fixed by including #includedir
   /etc/sudoers.d into the /etc/sudoers file.
2. Similar problem with the directory /etc/network/interfaces.d/
   which is read by the command
   source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*
   which might be absent on earlier debian versions
Sometimes (when there are too many wifi networks) you have to choose the optimal
wireless-channel in the file /etc/network/interfaces.d/wifi-switcher.
