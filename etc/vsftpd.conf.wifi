# This vsftpd configuration has been written for the wifi-switcher package.
# It is not supposed to be opened to the big internet audience; note that it allows uploading.
# Note: older versions (e.g., 2.3.5) of may not start with "allow_writeable_chroot=YES":
allow_writeable_chroot=YES
# if you allow file upload (write_enable), consider limiting the size of the ftp directory by
# placing it either on a separate partition, or inside the (mounted with "loop" option) file.
# [Attempt to enforce quota for the actual ftp directory owner (see guest_username) may result in server hang up.]
