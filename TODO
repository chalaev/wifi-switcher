1. Add a new setting into templates: wifiChannel, for now 6 is used in /etc/hostapd/wifi-switcher.conf
   and in /etc/network/interfaces.d/wifi-switcher
2. Add dnsmasq (for simple dns sharing) as an alternative for isc-dhcp-server.
3. Test /usr/share/wifi-switcher/hotspot.sh in case there are no networks.
4. In /usr/share/wifi-switcher/hotspot.sh use "while getopts" loop to pass options
   a. wifi interface
   b. name of the adhoc network
5. Improve package description in debian/control: This is a perl wrapper for
   wpa_supplicant, wpa_cli, and udhcpc.  Switches between wifi networks configured in
   the wpasupplicant configuration file.
6. Move vsftpd, hostapd, and isc-dhcp-server from "Depends" to "Recommends"
   section of the debian/control file and set up trigger so that wifi-switcher
   is reconfigured every time they are installed/removed.
7. use osd notifications like "(dis)connected from/to wifi network"
   -- use dunst or another notification daemon to notify user of connections.
8. create emacs interface for wifi-switcher
9. Submenu for unavailable interfaces to conveniently froget them.
10. Focus on using systemd? I do not want to loose compatibility with sysvinit...
11. test the package in a situation when no wifi networks are available
12. share internet from a 3G usb modem.
