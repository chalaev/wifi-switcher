#
# wifi-switcher is a simple alternative to wicd and network-manager.
# It uses icewm/pdmenu together with command-line text-mode utilities
# (hostapd, wpa_supplicant, udhcpc, vsftpd)
# to switch between wifi-networks and organize a wireless hotspot.

# Wireless network interface (see output of `ip addr ls` for available interfaces):
wifi_interface="wlan0"
