* wifi-switcher-related issues
  1. Somehow vsftpd and hostapd are not killed after the end of the ad-hoc wifi session. It is also possible that they are auto-launched at startup. Because of
     that, wifi-switcher thinks that it is always in the "server mode".
  2. does not write psk into the /etc/wpa_supplicant/wifi-switcher.conf for a newly connected network.
     when the ssid has space(s).
  3. Rarely, wifi-switcher detects no wifi networks, even though there are some
     available. In this case restart the service (under root):
     service wifi-switcher restart
* wifi-switcher-unrelated issues
1. When I soft-block wifi with Fn-F2 key combination on my Asus EEE, and then suspend the system with Fn-z (Fn-F1), wifi gets hard-blocked (see the output of
   `rfkill list`), and only reboot helps to restore it.
2. Unfortunately people tend to broadcast more than they actually need littering ether
   with numerous hotspots. Sometimes (when there are too many wifi networks) you have to
   choose the optimal wireless-channel in the file
   /etc/network/interfaces.d/wifi-switcher. I had to do this when there were 30 wifi
   networks available simultaneously in my office; these 30 networks were spread among
   only three channels, and my (non-free firmware-brcm80211) wireless-card driver
   perhaps does not realise that one should choose less occupied radio frequencies
   (channels) for better connection quality.
3. Sometimes wifi-switcher can not connect to an unprotected network, see iwlist-scan.output

* Issues on older debian versions
1. Inactive /etc/sudoers.d/ As of Debian version 1.7.2p1-1, the default /etc/sudoers
   file created on installation of the package now includes the directive:
   #includedir /etc/sudoers.d
   Problem: in earlier linux versions, files in
   /etc/sudoers.d/ might not be read.  This can be fixed by including #includedir
   /etc/sudoers.d into the /etc/sudoers file.
2. Similar problem with the directory /etc/network/interfaces.d/
   which is read by the command
   source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*
   which might be absent on earlier debian versions
